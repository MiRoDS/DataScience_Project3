# DataScience_Project3
3rd project of Data Science Nanodegree program - Recommendations with IBM

This is the third project of the Data Science Nanodegree program. In the Jupyter-Notebook file Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb real data from the IBM Watson Studio platform is analyzed.

1. Installations: There is no installation required. You just need Jupyter-Notebook, e.g. from an Anaconda installation. Make sure that you also have Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and pickle.

2. Project Motivation: Goal was to develop concepts for the recommendation of articles.

3. File Description: Just load Recommendations_with_IBM.ipynb into your Jupyter-Notebook. Furthermore, you need the data files 'data/user-item-interactions.csv' and 'data/articles_community.csv' and the project_tests (all from Udacity).

4. How to Interact with the project: Go through the cells and execute them.

5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements, etc.: Thanks to Udacity for the interesting introduction into recommendation engines.
